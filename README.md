# Client-Server-Chat

A simple client-server program using Python sockets. This program was converted into a two player tic-tac-toe game
with the client being one player and server acting as the other player. The board is updated once input is 
recieved and is then checked for a winner. Once a game has been won or tied, the client prompts the server to play 
again or exit. Upon exit, the sockets are closed.
